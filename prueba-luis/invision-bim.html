       <h2 class="titulo"> Investment Overview</h2>

       <p>RealtyShares is pleased to present its investors with an opportunity to invest in debt securities related to a senior loan that is secured by a portfolio of multifamily properties located throughout Scottsdale, AZ. The portfolio was 96% occupied according to the April 2018 rent roll and is comprised of 49 units across ten (10) buildings (each property individually, a "Property," and collectively, the "Properties" or “Portfolio”). The majority of the Portfolio is concentrated in infill locations approximately 1 mile southwest of Downtown Scottsdale, with a couple of other small buildings (7 units total) located closer to the Phoenix International Airport.</p>
        
       <p>The Sponsorship is comprised of three experienced co-borrowing tenants in common (collectively “Sponsor” or “Borrower”). The Sponsor’s business plan includes a robust capital improvement plan designed to improve the Properties overall curb appeal, systems upgrades, and unit interiors to command higher rent premiums throughout. The loan includes a $600,000 capital expenditure reserve to cover a portion of the total capex budget. 
       </p>
       <p >Investors are to receive debt securities (borrower payment dependent notes, or "Notes") of a RealtyShares subsidiary, RS Lending, Inc. ("RS Lending," or the "Company") that will make the senior loan to the tenants in common (the "Borrowers") that will hold title to the Properties. The performance of the Notes is tied to the performance of that loan, which loan is secured by a first lien against the Properties. The Notes themselves are unsecured obligations of the Company.
       </p>
   
       <p>Notwithstanding the minimum investment amount stated above, RealtyShares will be offering to first-time platform investors a lesser minimum investment amount of $5,000. The higher minimum investment amount stated above will continue to apply for all other investors. Please contact <a href="#">invest@realtyshares.com</a>  if you are interested in taking advantage of the lower investment minimum being offered to first-time platform investors.
       </p>
   
       <p>The total raise of $4,000,000 is being conducted in tranches; this is tranche 3 of 4. The loan metrics described here reflect the total loan amount of $4,000,000.
       </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <b>Primary Metro:</b>  The Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was recently ranked #11 on Forbes' annual "America's Fastest-Growing Cities 2018" list, up from #16 from its 2017 ranking. Forbes expects the MSA to have 2.0% population growth and 2.7% job growth in 2018; you can read that article <a href="https://www.forbes.com">here.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
                <li> <b> High Occupancy Portfolio & Submarket: </b> Per the April 2018 rent roll, the Portfolio is 96% occupied, with only 2 units vacant across the Portfolio. Additionally, according to REIS, B/C grade assets within the South Scottsdale submarket finished Q1 2018 with an average vacancy of 4.1% and 3.9% for 2017.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <ul>
                    <li> <b> Neighborhood Population Growth:</b>  The population within a 1-mile radius of the Portfolio has increased 16.1% since 2010, from 15,644 to the 2018 population of 18,168 (ESRI). The population is expected to increase an additional 10.9% over the next 5 years to over 20,000.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <ul>
                        <li> <b> Central Location:</b> With most of the Portfolio located in the community near the intersection of E Osborn Road and N 68th Street, the Property boast excellent access to Downtown Scottsdale and the greater metropolitan area. The Properties are located approximately 1 mile southwest of Downtown Scottsdale (5 minutes), approximately 5 miles northeast of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (20 minutes), and approximately 8 miles west of Downtown Phoenix (20 minutes).</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <ul>
                            <li> <b>Senior Position:</b> Investors will be purchasing Notes of the Company that relate to the senior loan secured by the Properties. The Company’s senior loan is to have priority in payment to the common equity of the Sponsor and other investors. In the event of a borrower default, the Company's enforcement remedies include foreclosure and sale of the Properties, which make such senior loans relatively less risky than other types of real estate investments (although risks remain -- see Risk Disclosures below).

                                <li> <b> Short-Term Loan:</b> The initial maturity date of the loan is May 11, 2020.  The short-term nature of the loan potentially helps to limit the investment's exposure to larger market fluctuations.</li>
                            </ul>
